# üìå Overview
The objective is to build a text classification model that categorizes math problems into specific topics. The approach involves:

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.

**Feature Extraction:** Utilizing TF-IDF to convert textual data into numerical features.

**Model Training:** Employing Logistic Regression for classification tasks.

**Evaluation:** Assessing model performance and making necessary adjustments.

**Submission:** Generating predictions on the test set and preparing a CSV file for submission.

## üìÅ Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files:

**kachallenges-series-1-classifying-math-problems-1 (1).ipynb & kachallenges-series-1-classifying-math-problems-2.ipynb:** Initial exploratory data analysis and preprocessing steps , Model training, evaluation, and prediction generation.

**train.csv:** Training dataset provided for the competition.

**test.csv:** Test dataset for which predictions are to be made.

**submission.csv:** Final predictions formatted for submission.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries
The project leverages the following tools and libraries:

**Python:**  Programming language used for implementation.

**Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.

**Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.

**TF-IDF Vectorizer:** Feature extraction technique for text data.

## üìà Results
The final model achieved satisfactory performance in classifying math problems into their respective categories.

**Private Score: 0.7920**

**Public Score: 0.7872**

**The submission.csv** file contains the predicted labels for the test dataset.
